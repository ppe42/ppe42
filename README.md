- 👋 Hi, I’m @Janine.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python, C, and working towards coding in the context of linguistic app support
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python through Codecademy and CS50X (Introduction to Coding - Harvard)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic Python projects that use Python to write linguistic rules of different languages 
(my focus is on Māori, but I'm also fairly fluent in French, a native English speaker, and learning Japanese).
- 📫 How to reach me - jrmloveslanguages@gmail.com
